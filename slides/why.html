<h1 class="centered">Why Webkit + CSS?</h1>
<p>
  Because Webkit is ahead of every other rendering engine. And CSS3 is presentational. 
  And Webkit implements some really cool stuff from CSS3 such as transitions and transforms.

<p>
  Webkit also implements animations. Some people argue this should be in the Javascript
  realm. Clearly, I don't agree with that.
