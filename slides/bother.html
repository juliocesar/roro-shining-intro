<h1 class="centered">Why bother?</h1>
<p>
  Shining is for presentations what Rails is for web apps, though a lot smaller, and
  hopefully it'll stay like that. Presentations (in general), are, in a nutshell,
  images and words, and sometimes *cough* audio right?

<p>
  That's what you get when you use Shining. Plus all the awesomeness available
  in HTML5 (e.g.: native audio/video). Also, things look <strong>really</strong>
  awesome when rendered in Webkit.
