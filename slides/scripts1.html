<h1 class="centered">Slide scripts</h1>
<p>
  Each slide can have a script along with it. "script" as in it dictates what will
  happen and when as that slide gets shown. Like for instance:
  <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: js">
  <![CDATA[
    0.5,  $('h1:first').addClass('shines')
    1,    $('h2').removeClass('hidden').addClass('appears-dramatically')
    2.5,
          $('p:first').addClass('x-spin')
          window.FOO = "avoid this sort of thing"
          console.log('all done!')
  ]]>
  </script>
</p>
<p>
  It features a tiny scheduling DSL so to speak. They're actually just shortcuts to
  a helper method available in <em>$.shining.scripts</em>. The above is pure Javascript,
  so go nuts!
</p>
<p>
  It still needs more abstraction. Ideally I don't want people to have to know the ins
  and outs of Webkit animations to be able to use it  :)
