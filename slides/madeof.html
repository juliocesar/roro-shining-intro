<h1 class="centered">What are slides made of?</h1>
<p>
  Slides are just HTML files sitting <em>ROOT/slides</em>. The slide index is listed in
  the preso "config file" <em>ROOT/config.json</em>. The index defines the order in 
  which your slides will appear.
</p>
<p>
  Slides can also have styles loaded for each one individually, so if you want a set
  of styles applied a slide named <em>win</em>, add a stylesheet named
  <em>ROOT/slides/win.css</em> and it will get loaded along.
</p>
<p>
  You know what else gets loaded along with slides? Slide scripts!
